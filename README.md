# A collection of sorting algorithms implemented in C++

## Bubble Sort
A slow sorting algorithm for the simplest data sets

| Case  | Performance |
| :---: | :---: |
| Worst case performance   | O(n^2)  |
| Best case performance  | O(n)  |
| Average case performance  | O(n^2)  |
| Auxiliary Space           | O(1)  |

## Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is often used when the data set is nearly sorted (it takes minimum time (Order of n))
Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order.

| Case  | Performance |
| :---: | :---: |
| Worst case performance   | O(n^2)  |
| Best case performance  | O(n)  |
| Average case performance  | O(n^2)  |
| Auxiliary Space           | O(1)  |

## Selection Sort

The good thing about selection sort is that can be useful when memory write is a costly operation.

| Case  | Performance |
| :---: | :---: |
| Worst case performance   | O(n^2)  |
| Best case performance  | O(n^2)  |
| Average case performance  | O(n^2)  |
| Auxiliary Space           | O(1)  |
